## About Me

I am a second year D.Phil. student in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). My study is co-supervised by [Prof. Niki Trigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Trigoni) and [Prof. Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/) and generously supported by the Taiwanese Government Scholarship to Study Abroad and the ACE-OPS grant. Prior to this, I worked as a research assistant in Computer Vision Lab, Academia Sinica, supervised by [Prof. Tyng-Luh Liu](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/) and [Prof. Hwann-Tzong Chen](https://htchen.github.io). I obtained my B.Eng. Computer Science degree from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk) (First Class Honours), completing multiple projects under the guidance of [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/), [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung), and [Prof. Long Quan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~quan/). I was an intern (and soon will be again!) at Adobe Research, working with [Dr. Matheus Gadelha](http://mgadelha.me).

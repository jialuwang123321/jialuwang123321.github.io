## About Me

I am a second year D.Phil. student in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). My study is co-supervised by Profs. [Niki Trigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Trigoni) and [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/) and generously supported by the Taiwanese Government Scholarship to Study Abroad, ACE-OPS grant, and St. Catherine's College Overseas Scholarship. Prior to this, I worked as a research assistant in Computer Vision Lab, Academia Sinica, supervised by Profs. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/) and [Hwann-Tzong Chen](https://htchen.github.io). I obtained my B.Eng. Computer Science degree from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk) (First Class Honours), completing multiple projects under the guidance of Profs [Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/), [Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung), and [Long Quan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~quan/). I am currently doing my second internship at Adobe Research.
